title: "Installing MEGA Sync Client on Ubuntu"

I really like MEGA.

From the [About us page](https://mega.nz/about):

> When we launched MEGA early 2013, global mass surveillance by rogue
> governments under the pretext of fighting terrorism was still a wild
> conjecture and its proponents were often touted as conspiracy theorists.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_%28service%29):

> Mega is a cloud storage and file hosting service produced by Mega Limited.
> The New Zealand-based website was launched on January 19, 2013, by Kim Dotcom.
> Mega mobile apps are available for Windows Phone, Android, BlackBerry 10 and iOS.

After [I installed the latest] version of the Ubuntu operating system, I went
to install all my apps including the Mega synchronization client that keeps
my local directories up to date with my MEGA cloud. So if someone updates a file
from a shared folder in the cloud then my local file also gets updated automatically.
If I want to add more files to the cloud I just drag and drop them using my local
native file manager, simple, super easy and with 50 Gigs for free it's awesome.

So I downloaded the [Sync Client] which is already available as a packaged binary
for Ubuntu 17.04, very nice. But when I ran the installer with the default application
which is called something like "Ubuntu Software" it just sat there when I clicked on
"Install" it did nothing.

# Terminal To The Rescue

Generally speaking a graphical user interface (GUI) can have a very real benefit
to users, especially *ilproficient* users as it may be able to slowly guide you
to what the actual program, the so-called "back-end" really wants from you which
is usually in a very specific rigid format.

The problem is that if the back-end has a problem sometimes the front-end, the
GUI, fails to inform you about it. So this is where the terminal comes in to help.
We bypass the GUI and interact directly with the system package installer back-end
``dpkg``.

First open a terminal a.k.a the "command line" that will run a program called a
*shell* which sends input and output (I/O) to and from the operating system (OS).
You can hit the *Search* button at the top of the Unity Launcher or just hit
``ctrl alt t``.

![Manual installation in the terminal][terminal]

Then use the ``cd`` command to *change directory* to Downloads:

    cd ~/Downloads

List the files with the ``ls`` command:

    ls

Here we can see the Mega package installer (you may have other files in there
in addition):

    megasync-xUbuntu_17.04_amd64.deb

Run the installer as *super user* with ``sudo`` which will prompt you for your
password and also check to make sure you are a privileged administrator listed in
the *sudoers* file:

    sudo dpkg --install megasync-xUbuntu_17.04_amd64.deb

My output looked like the following:

    Selecting previously unselected package megasync.
    (Reading database ... 197987 files and directories currently installed.)
    Preparing to unpack megasync-xUbuntu_17.04_amd64.deb ...

    dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of megasync:

      Package libcrypto++6 is not installed.

    Errors were encountered while processing:
     megasync

I noticed that there were two *unmet dependencies* errors:

      Package libc-ares2 is not installed.
      Package libcrypto++6 is not installed.

Installing these two dependencies can be done on the command line as well:

    sudo apt-get install libc-ares2 libcrypto++6

The dependencies installed fine:

    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    The following NEW packages will be installed:

And then I ran the package installer again:

    sudo dpkg --install megasync-xUbuntu_17.04_amd64.deb

But this time the package manager found that all dependencies had been met:

    (Reading database ... 198010 files and directories currently installed.)

So now I can run mega when my system boots up and it keeps all my files up to
date. Nice.
