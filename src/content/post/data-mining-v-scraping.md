# What is the difference between data mining and web scraping?

Data mining and web scraping are both techniques used to extract information from various sources, but they serve different purposes and operate in different contexts:

  <tr>
    <td>Data Source</td>
    <td><p>Structured data stored in databases, data warehouses, or other structured formats</p></td>
    <td><p>Unstructured or semi-structured data from HTML web pages</p></td>

    <td>Examples of Applications</td>
    <td><p>Customer segmentation, market basket analysis, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, recommendation systems</p></td>
    <td><p>Price monitoring, content aggregation, lead generation, sentiment analysis, competitive analysis</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Goal</td>
    <td><p>To glean meaning from patterns of data</p></td>
    <td><p>To format gathered data</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

In summary, while both data mining and web scraping involve extracting information, they serve different purposes and operate in distinct contexts. Data mining focuses on analyzing structured data to discover patterns, while web scraping extracts data from websites, primarily unstructured or semi-structured data, for various purposes.
